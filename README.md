**Walkpoint** This is the application that was written with Swift in Swift Hackathon 1st. My team name is Prakapongsamphorcure it means "Canned fish with three chefs", Opek Sitthinon, Kik Attichet, Kim Pranchayut and Teacher Nattee.

**Objective** is to decrease the number of people using elevators and other forms of transportation to save electricity and fossil fuels by walking.

** Method** is that we let organizations or anyone can create a QR code and put it anywhere so the user can scan and get a token for buying tickets, reducing the cost of anything the organization puts it on. Now it might seem unfair for organizations to reduce costs without any benefits, right? But what if we put a QR code on the staircases or footpaths for pedestrians.Now we save resources, and those resources cost money, so we let organizations turn that money into tickets.Â 

I let you guys see the interface so it might make you guys better understand the method, but this is just prototype It might have a good frontend, but lots of the backend is not finished yet.
